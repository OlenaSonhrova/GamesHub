# Games Hub

"Games Hub" is an app where users can find games to organize leisure activities for children, teenagers, young adults, and adults. Users can either use existing games or create and add their own. The app works in both online and offline modes, but not all features are available in offline mode.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OlenaSonhrova/react_first.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GamesHub
   
3. Install dependencies:
   
   You need to install all necessary dependencies before running the project:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
4. Android Installation:

   - Install Android SDK:
     
      Ensure you have Android Studio installed and the Android SDK set up. If you donâ€™t have it installed:
      - Download and install Android Studio.
      - During the installation, make sure you add necessary SDK components such as Android SDK and Android Virtual Device       (AVD).
     
   - Set environment variables:
   
   You need to add the Android SDK paths to your environment variables. For macOS or Linux, add the following to your         ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc (or the appropriate shell configuration file):
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

   
For Windows, add these paths through "Environment Variables" in the system settings.

   - Start an emulator or connect a device:
   
      To use an Android emulator, open Android Studio and launch your emulator via the AVD Manager.
      Alternatively, connect your real Android device via USB and enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging.
     
   - Run the app:
   
      You can now run your app on Android using the following command:
      ```bash
      npx react-native run-android
   
   This will start the Metro Bundler and install the app on the connected device or emulator.

5. iOS Installation (for macOS users):

   - Install Xcode
     
     Ensure that Xcode is installed from the Mac App Store. This is necessary for running your React Native project on iOS.
   - Install CocoaPods:
     
     CocoaPods is a dependency manager for iOS. Install it if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     sudo gem install cocoapods
     
   - Navigate to the ios folder of your project and install iOS dependencies:
     
     ```bash
     cd ios
     pod install
     cd ..
     
   - Run the iOS app: You can run the app on an iOS simulator or a real device. For the simulator:
     
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios
   
   Alternatively, you can open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode and run the app from there.

6. Troubleshooting:

If you encounter errors, check whether all dependencies and tools are installed correctly and make sure your device or emulator is properly connected.
   
Once done, your app should run on Android.
